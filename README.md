<h1>Data Analysis and Visualization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project is designed for data filtering, analysis, and visualization using a CSV file as input. The program allows users to specify a dataset and define a date range and column selection via command-line arguments. It leverages pandas to read and filter the data based on the provided start and end dates, then further refines the dataset by selecting specific columns. The project calculates differences between selected columns to extract meaningful insights and utilizes matplotlib to generate visual representations of the processed data. This project is valuable for trend analysis and data comparison, making it particularly useful in domains like finance, healthcare, or scientific research where time-series data analysis is essential.
